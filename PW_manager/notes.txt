--- TO DO ---

1 -
ADD A FUNCTION THAT GENERATES NEW KEYS
+ RECODES OLD PW for added security
*** see keys in my func

2 - have the program ask for their name and use their name as
    an identifier to find their json file
    i.e elmedin creates elmedinPWM.json
    would require: dixing functions, moving filename to an arugment for function

3 - add check for each function to check if if file has any data.

4 - NEW ENCRYPTION IDEA
    =using the current method of 1:1 from decrypt_string and encrypt_string
    take the byte code (i.e 0100101) and move x [x is an int that would be a given arg]
    down the list and use that new char as the new encrypted char
    i.e a -> ; whos byte is 0101011 but 3 down is 0101111 which would [for example] be ']'

5 - add a access file password for each existing file and prompt one when a new file is creatd
    - this password will always be requested in order to access the file; for security.
